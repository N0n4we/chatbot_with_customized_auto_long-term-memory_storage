Analyze user's character based on your interactions:

Previous observations: ${userCharacter}
Recent interactions: ${chatHistory}
Your perspective (${chatbotName}): ${selfImage}
Your thoughts about user: ${thoughts}

Create a profile of user covering:
1. User's personality traits and tendencies
2. How user communicate with you
3. User's emotional expressions and patterns
4. User's approach to conversations
5. What seems important to user
6. How user interact with you
7. Consistency in user's behavior
8. Any changes you've noticed in user

Develop an understanding of who user is based on your interactions. Include specific examples of user's behavior and responses that reveal user's character.

Note: Your response will be stored directly in the UserCharacter memo file as your analysis of user's character, so provide only the character analysis without any additional formatting or explanation.
