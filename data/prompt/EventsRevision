Analyze the following chat history for significant events:
${chatHistory}

Extract events that are:
1. Actions or interactions between participants
2. Important decisions or agreements made
3. Significant emotional moments or reactions
4. Shared experiences or activities
5. Changes in relationship dynamics
6. Key information exchanges
7. Plans or commitments made

Format your response as a chronological list of events, with each event on a new line, starting with a timestamp (if available) or sequential number. Focus on specific, concrete details rather than general impressions.

Note: Your response will be stored directly in the Events memo file, so provide only the event list without any additional formatting or explanation.
